## Extra

### Chicken Jockeys

"After the unfortunate success of 'A Minecraft Movie' last year, and having now acquired Warner Bros, Netflix have realised that there is no depths of quality that a sequel could sink to, that doesn't also make them another $950 million.

The previous lead CGI expert at Warner Bros has also mysteriously vanished in Florida, with reports that he was eaten by a bald green man vaguely resembling Shrek.

Netflix is therefore in dire need of a new ""Chicken Jockey"" for ""A Minecraft Movie 2"", and is refusing to spend the budget to hire someone new. 

You may therefore pick TWO members of the staff team to play the Chicken Jockey. Who do you choose to play the Chicken, who do you choose to play the Jockey, and why?"
