# Client Macros

**Note: If you have any further questions regarding our macro rulesets, please contact the staff team and we'll be more than happy to clarify these rules further.**

## Not Allowed
In general, automation macros are not permitted on Slabserver. This includes most mods which include macros as part of its features.

## Partially Allowed
- Blueprint/schematic mods such as Schematica or Litematica are allowed, however, the "Printer" or "Easy place" features that automatically place blocks for you are not.
- Inventory features are partially allowed, see this [page](../client-mods) for more details.

## Allowed
We permit two types of macros on the server:

- Auto-join scripts to rejoin the server after our daily server restarts.
- Any action that can be achieved by just weighing down a button on your mouse or keyboard on a vanilla Minecraft client, such as holding right click for an AFK fish farm.
    - This includes repeated actions on a timer _(e.g. swinging a sword)_ or delay _(e.g. swinging a sword with a 1.5 second delay)_, as this is achievable through Minecraft and OS settings without the use of mods or external programs.
    - This applies whether your game is focused or unfocused, otherwise certain behaviour would only be achievable for those with secondary devices or VMs.
