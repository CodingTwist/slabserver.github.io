**Note: This is not a comprehensive list, just the ones we've been asked to give an explicit opinion on. Feel free to ask staff about a mod, and it will be listed here too.**

## Allowed
- Performance mods (Sodium, Optifine, Starlight, etc)
- Zoom mods (Optifine, LogicalZoom, etc)
- Purely informational HUD/GUI features, e.g.:
  - MiniHUD
  - NBT Tooltip
  - Light level overlay
  - Shulker box previews
- Several visual features, e.g.:
  - Changing brightness
  - Disabling fog
- Recording mods (e.g. Replay mod)
- Automatic rejoin mods/macros

## Partially allowed
- Schematic blueprint mods (e.g. Litematica).
  - "Printer" or "Easy place" features are not allowed.
  - The `autoPickSchematicBlock` feature of TweakerMore is allowed for the remainder of Season 3. We will decide whether to continue allowing this feature for Season 4 at a later date.
- Mini-map mods, but cave views and entity radars must be disabled.
- Some inventory management features are allowed:
  - Item scrolling ¹
  - Moving multiple stacks at a time (e.g. "Move matching items" in Inventory Profiles Next)
  - Continuous crafting ²
  - Inventory sorting ¹, limited to your own inventory and containers. Do not sort other people's items without their permission.
  - Auto refill of items in hand slots, except for totems, potions, or other items that give a competitive advantage over other players.
  - Other features are not allowed. Please contact staff if you'd like to see other features considered.
- Free camera is allowed for the following uses:
  - Inspecting your own contraptions, farms, and builds.
  - Inspecting others' contraptions, farms, and builds, with the owner's or staff's permission.
  - Getting an alternative perspective of the immediate surroundings visible to you. e.g. the exterior of a build on the surface, or the interior of a room you are in.

¹ Inventory features like chest sorting and item scrolling may spam CoreProtect logs and make it extremely difficult to perform container checks. Keep this in mind if you'd like your valuables to be protected from theft.

² Allowed as long as the feature emulates a simple "click and drag" macro, e.g. the one from Inventory Profiles Next. One-click crafters, e.g. from Item Scroller, are not allowed.

  - Inspecting others' contraptions, farms, or builds without permission.

  - Viewing or finding entities not visible to you, except within your own builds or with the owner's or staff's permission.
  - Viewing or finding players not visible to you, except with the subject’s or staff’s permission.
- "Printer" or "Easy place" features are not allowed in Litematica or similar mods.
