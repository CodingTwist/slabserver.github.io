# Pl3xMap

Pl3xMap adds a world map viewer for our Survival server, which can be accessed at [map.slabserver.org](https://map.slabserver.org).

## Hiding

Players can hide themselves on the server map by using the `/map hide` command, and `/map show` to show themselves again.

## Markers

Players can label their builds using a placed [Banner](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Banner), that display the same way banners do on a vanilla map.

### Adding a Marker

Right-click with an open map in your main hand on a placed banner to add a marker to Pl3xMap at that position. The name and colour of the banner will also be used for the marker.

### Removing a Marker

Left-clicking or breaking the placed banner will make a corresponding marker disappear from the map.
