# Sleeping Requirements

Only 33% of active players in the Overworld, up to a maximum of 5 players total, need to be in bed to skip the night.

A player does not need to sleep if:

* They are in the Nether or the End
* They are AFK (have not moved for 5 minutes or more)
* They are in Creative or Spectator mode
