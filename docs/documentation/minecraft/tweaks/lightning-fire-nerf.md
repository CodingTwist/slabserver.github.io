# Lightning Fire Nerf

Lightning strikes can only set fires if it strikes netherrack or magma blocks, to prevent the need for glass ceilings over spawn or disabling fire tick completely.

!!! info 
    Fire only has a [20-65%](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fire#Extinguishing) chance of being put out by rain when ticked, making lightning strikes significantly more destructive to uncovered flammable buildings - especially in [spawn chunks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_chunk) on Multiplayer that are constantly loaded.
