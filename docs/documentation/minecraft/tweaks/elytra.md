# Elytra

When the Ender Dragon is respawned and killed by a player, it has a 40% chance to drop Elytra. This increases by 20% for each level of the 'Looting' enchantment that the player has on their weapon.

| Enchantments | Drop Chance |
|------------|---------|
| No Looting | 40% |
| Looting I | 60% |
| Looting II | 80% |
| Looting III | 100% |
