# Enderman Griefing Nerf

To prevent destruction of player builds, Enderman griefing is disabled in the Main World, with the exception of picking up grass blocks, mycelium, podzol, and melons in the End dimension. This exception allows for the creation of griefing-based farms for those blocks.

These blocks have survival-friendly substitutes for map art that produce the same colour, as documented on the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Map_item_format#Full_color_tables).

Enderman griefing is not disabled in the Resource World.
